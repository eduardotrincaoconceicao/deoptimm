## Overview

Differential Evolution (DE) stochastic heuristic algorithms for global optimization of problems with and without general constraints. The aim is to curate a collection of its variants that

1. do not sacrifice simplicity of design,
2. are essentially tuning-free, and
3. can be efficiently implemented directly in MATLAB code.

Currently, it only provides an implementation of the 'jDE' algorithm by [Brest at al. (2006)](https://doi.org/10.1109/TEVC.2006.872133) for single-objective optimization.

## Installation

deoptimm requires MATLAB R2021a and above. It also requires the Statistics and Machine Learning Toolbox. For the time being deoptimm will not be packaged in a toolbox. Simply download the source code and documentation to a convenient folder. Help documentation is available in the form of a live script found under the folder _help_.
